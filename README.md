# Search Plugin üîç [![license](https://img.shields.io/github/license/AleksaC/nnlib.svg?maxAge=2592000)](https://github.com/AleksaC/dldidact/blob/master/LICENSE)

Chromium extension that allows you to focus search bar of the page using a keyboard shortcut.

## About  ‚ÑπÔ∏è

The extension works as a toggle - if the search bar is focused it will
get blurred otherwise it will focus the first search bar it comes across.

If you'd like to know how the extension works or would like to customize it,
take a look at the code. It's 30 lines long so it won't be hard to understand it.

Due to high variance in the way the search bars are implemented across the web
it is really hard to cover many of the websites, but this extension works
on Twitter, Facebook, Google, YouTube, GitHub, Reddit, Quora, Twitch, Stack
Overflow and many others. Since this pretty much covers all the websites I'd want
to use the extension on, I never bothered to try to make it more robust. Every effort
to do so provides diminishing returns anyway.

I've actually built this extension over a year ago and have been using it ever
since. At first I thought it was trivial so I didn't want to share it, but after
using it for so long I thought other people might find it useful as well so here it is.

### Installation
